Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engneering refers to the process of developing,testing and maintaining software systems. It's important as it ensures a software is reliable,efficient and meets user's needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The introduction of Software engineering by Nato- This assisted in streamlining the software enginering by bringing structured control flow that helpedte code to be more clear nd understandable.
Agile methodologies- Since the process is iterative it also requires customer feedback so that it can work to its best mode and meet user needs.
Introduction of structured programming-The structured control flow constructs helped to improve code clarity and maintainability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis- This basically involves collecting information from the users,clients or business stakeholders to understand what it is that they need and documentating those needs so as to develop the software.
System Design- This involves creating a prototype of the system.Tis involves looking at the architecture which is the database,data flow diagrams and bascically understanding how they will connect.
Implementation- This involves translating the design stage which is source based into actual code which is the machine language so that a computer can execute it.
Testing- This allows to remove errors and bugs. One can decide to test in modules that is in stages or even when they finish the whole program they can decide to test.
Deployment- This involves releasing the software to its target audience so that they can use it and provide feedback that can assist in further developing the system.
Maintenance- Monitor the software for defects, performance issues, and user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
They are both methods that can be used in software development.
Waterfall is linear, suitable for projects with clear and standard requirements, while Agile is iterative and flexible, ideal for projects where requirements are expected to dvance with time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers are responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes up the software
Quaity assuarance Engineers are responsible for validating that the software meets specified requirements and quality standards. 
Project Managers are responsible for planning, executing, and closing projects. They ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and according to scope and quality standards.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They Streamline the development process by providing a centralized, feature-rich environment for coding, debugging, and managing projects. EXAMPLES Visual studio Code, Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirements may change frequently due to evolving business needs- Adopt the Agile methodology.
Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and complex. They can use some debugging tools to assist them.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
